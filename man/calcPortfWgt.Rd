  Account)
}
\arguments{
\item{Portfolio}{a portfolio object structured with initPortf()}

\item{Symbols}{an instrument identifier for a symbol included in the portfolio}

\item{Dates}{dates to return the calculation over formatted as xts range}

\item{denominator}{string describing the deniminator, see Description}

\item{Account}{an Account object containing Portfolio summaries}

\description{
Portfolio weights may be calculated differently depending on their use.
By default, this function uses denominator of 'Gross.Value', the second most common 
option will likely be 'Net.Value'. 
For separating long and short weights, 'Long.Value' and 'Short.Value' may be 
needed as denominators.
