\arguments{
\item{Portfolios}{portfolio string}

\item{Symbols}{character vector of symbol strings, default NULL}

\item{use}{for determines whether numbers are calculated from transactions or round-trip trades (for tradeStats) or equity curve (for dailyStats)}

\item{tradeDef}{string to determine which definition of 'trade' to use. Currently "flat.to.flat" (the default) and "flat.to.reduced" are implemented.}

\item{inclZeroDays}{TRUE/FALSE, whether to include zero P&L days in daily calcs, default FALSE for backwards compatibility.}

\description{
This function calculates trade-level statistics on a symbol or symbols within a portfolio or portfolios.
}
\details{
Every book on trading, broker report on an analytical trading system, 
or blog post seems to have a slightly different idea of what trade statistics 
are necessary, and how they should be displayed.  We choose not to make 
value judgments of this type, aiming rather for inclusiveness with 
post-processing for display.
  
The output of this function is a \code{\link{data.frame}} with named columns for each statistic.  
Each row is a single portfolio+symbol combination. Values are returned in full precision.
It is likely that the output of this function will have more than you wish
to display in all conditions, but it should be suitable for reshaping for display.  
Building summary reports from this data.frame may be easily accomplished using 
something like \code{textplot} or \code{\link{data.frame}}, with rounding, 
fancy formatting, etc. as your needs dictate.

Option \code{inclZeroDays}, if \code{TRUE}, will include all transaction P&L, 
including for days in which the strategy was not in the market, 
for daily statistics.  
This can prevent irrationally good looking daily statistics for strategies
which spend a fair amount of time out of the market.  For strategies which 
are always in the market, the statistics should be (nearly) the same.  
Default is \code{FALSE} for backwards compatibility.

If you have additional trade statistics you want added here, please share.  
We find it unlikely that any transaction-level statistics that can be  
calculated independently of strategy rules could be considered proprietary.

Special Thanks for contributions to this function from:
\describe{
  \item{Josh Ulrich}{ for adding multiple-portfolio support, fixing bugs, and improving readability of the code }
  \item{Klemen Koselj}{ for median stats, num trades, and win/loss ratios }
  \item{Mark Knecht}{ for suggesting Profit Factor and largest winner/largest loser }
}

WARNING: we're not sure this function is stable/complete yet.  If you're using it, please give us feedback!
}
\note{
TODO document each statistic included in this function, with equations 

TODO add more stats, potentially
PerformanceAnalytics: skewness, kurtosis, upside/downside semidieviation, Sortino

mean absolute deviation stats

more Tharpe/Kestner/Tradestation stats, e.g.
K-factor
RINA Index
Percent time in the market
Buy and hold return

Josh has suggested adding \%-return based stats too
