portfolios: a list of portfolio object names to attach to the account

Outputs
Constructs multi-column xts object used to store aggregated portfolio 
calculations

NOTES
An Account object is a list of portfolios with portfolio summary information

The Account object is modeled on the CFTC Thirteen-column presentation table.
Start with the CFTC six column presentation, which includes:
Beg.Eq, Additions, Withdrawals, Net.Perf, End.Eq, Period.ROR
No reason to persist Period.ROR, and Beg.Eq = Previous End.Eq,
So we're left with four columns.  Note that Period.ROR can be calc'd 
several different ways and is best left as a function.

To get to the CFTC thirteen columns add:
Gross.Realized, Commission, Net.Realized, Interest, Ch.Unrealized,
Advisory.Fees, Wealth.Index 
Again, no need to add Wealth.Index. Eventually, these additional 
columns will be useful.  
Gross.Realized will be calculated as (Net) Realized.PL + Txn.Fees
}
\note{
TODO Add calcPeriodROR function

TODO Adddd functions addCapital, drawCapital, addFees

initDate and initEq can be used in addCapital to initalize the account?
Track cash at this level???
Calc gross PL and subtract fees? Or calc net PL and add fees.
