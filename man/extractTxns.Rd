\title{Extract transactions from a portfolio}
\usage{
extractTxns(Portfolio)
}
\arguments{
\item{Portfolio}{string identifying the portfolio to extract from}
}
\value{
String vector of \code{\link{addTxn}} calls that would replicate the given portfolio.
}
\description{
This function reverse-engineers \code{\link{addTxn}} calls for all the 
transactions in \code{Portfolio}.
This is the fundamental task required to create a reproducible example, 
as it would replicate the state of the $txn slot in the portfolio 
after each \code{addTxn} call.
}
\details{
While market data, expected results, portfolio and account setup, etc, are also required, 
these can usually be deduced or equivalent formulations can be found.

For transactions, only the exact \code{addTxn} parameters will recreate the $txn slot. 
This function creates that reproducibility, since the result (stored in 'x') 
can be used to regenerate transactions with \code{eval(parse(text=x))}.
